# microdata
Small test with parsing [microdata](https://microdata.codeplex.com), using [VueJs](https://vuejs.org) and [Materalize](http://materializecss.com/)
Also has some code for using [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper), [DapperCRUD](https://github.com/daleholborow/iayos.DapperCRUD) and [FluentMigrator](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator) to manage a SQL database, but that code isnt really used atm
